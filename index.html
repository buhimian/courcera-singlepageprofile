            <h1>Hi, I'm Sreeram K S! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span></h1>
            <p class="description">I am a seasoned Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience in both IT product and services industries, specializing in Java backend development and microservices architecture. My expertise includes Spring Boot, Spring Batch, JPA, JDBC, and Oracle Database, along with front-end technologies like Angular, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

            Currently at Tech Mahindra, I focus on migrating legacy systems to scalable microservices architectures, improving performance and system reliability. Throughout my career, I have led and mentored teams, managing complex projects from conception to deployment, while leveraging Agile methodologies for efficient execution.

            I hold an Oracle Certified Java SE 11 Developer certification and have completed advanced Spring and Java training on Udemy. Expanding my expertise, I am now diving into AI and cloud computing to transition into the AI/ML domain.

            Beyond work, I am passionate about traveling, adventure sports (bungee jumping), trekking, drawing, and writing. I enjoy exploring new cultures and pushing creative boundaries.

            I am eager to connect with professionals in software engineering, cloud computing, and AI to collaborate on innovative solutions and industry advancements. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€</p>
